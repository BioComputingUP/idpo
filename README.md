# Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Ontology

Description: The Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Ontology (IDPO) defines concepts and relationships that describe the structural states, dynamic transitions, and functional roles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Its terms and definitions are grounded in the terminology used by the IDP research community and derived from scientific literature in the field.
IDPO aims to standardize vocabulary across experimental and computational studies, promote consistent annotation of IDP-related data, and facilitate integration and interoperability across biomedical and structural biology databases. It serves as a foundational resource for supporting research, data sharing, and knowledge discovery in the study of protein disorder.
